# KYC demos in iOS app
KYC works well in a browser but doesn't work well in an iOS app(WKWebView).  Here, we extract the related code to make it publicly available.

We can test these demo pages in the iOS app to see if they work well.

## How to test:
Open these pages directly in an iOS app:
- https://rebilly.github.io/kyc-demos-in-ios-app/animation.html
- https://rebilly.github.io/kyc-demos-in-ios-app/file-upload.html
- https://rebilly.github.io/kyc-demos-in-ios-app/selfie-camera.html
- https://rebilly.github.io/kyc-demos-in-ios-app/selfie-face-liveness.html

Or, run these demos locally and open them in an iOS app.
