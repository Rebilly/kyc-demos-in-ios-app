<p>
    We use a native input[type="file"] component to upload a file, and it can also take a picture without requesting your
    camera permission on mobile.
    <br>
    So the behavior of the input[type="file"] is quite different between mobile and desktop. Try opening this page on both mobile and desktop to see the difference.
</p>
<input
        type="file"
        accept="image/png,image/jpeg,image/gif,application/pdf"
/>
<br>
<br>
You'll find:
<ul>
    <li>It can only upload a file on desktop</li>
    <li>It can upload a file on mobile and also take a photo, whether it's the front or rear camera</li>
    <li>Interactive logic is different, UI is different</li>
</ul>
<p>So if a selfie(both face detection or face liveness) is not required on the mobile, the native input component is
    enough.
